# Predicting IMDB Scores
## An analysis of movie information to predict IMDB scores

This project consists of three parts:

1. Scraping data from IMDB and Box Office Mojo
2. Feature engineering
3. Use linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosted regressors to find the best model

Presentation slides and code are included in this repo

For a detailed description of my methodology and results, please refer to my blog.
